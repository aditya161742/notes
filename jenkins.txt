2) On CMD goto that location and run: java -jar jenkins.war
3) on CMD it will give password for starting jenkins, copy that password.

-> How to change home directory of jenkins, i.e "/users/Aditya/.jenkins".  ??

Why we want to change default home directory of jenkins  ??

So that we can move it to a location which has enough space. As there is lot of data stored by jenkins, so we might need more space.

1) start jenkins: by running CMD: java -jar jenkins.war
2) Goto http:localhost:8080 -> manage jenkins -> configure system, here we can see our home directory.
3) suppose we want to make "C:/tools" as home directory. So we need to copy all data to our new directory.
4) change environment variables - JENKINS_HOME and set to new directory.
5) restart jenkins, by going http://localhost:8080/restart

This change is temporary , to make it parmanent goto "users/Aditya/" and search for ".bash_profile" and add "export JENKINS_HOME="C:/tools" and save it.

-> CLI for jenkins:

1) Goto: manage jenkins -> configure global security -> enable security (check)
2) Goto http:localhost:8080/cli and download cli-jar and save at any location.
3) Goto that location and Then run java -jar jenkins-cli.jar, then it will ask passphrase. For that goto admin(drop down at top right) -> configure -> SSH public keys (use this keys)
