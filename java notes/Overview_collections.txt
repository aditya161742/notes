															Overview Of collections





-> Limitations of array:

	1) Arrays are fixed in size. i.e we should know size of aray before using it.
	2) Array can hold only homogenous elements.
	Example:

	 	Student[] s = new Student[10000];

	 	s[0] = new Student();		(Correct)
	 	s[1] = new Customer();     (Wrong)

	 	We can solve this problem by using Object type Arryas.

	 		Example:

	 		Object[] a = new Object[10000];
	 		a[0] = new Student();	(Correct)
	 		a[1] = new Customer();   (correct)
	3) There is no underline data structure , therefore there are no readymade method support is not available for every requeremnet we have to write the code expicitly which increses compexity of programming.



	To overcome above problems of array we should go for Collections concept.


-> Performance point of view Arrays are recommended over Collections, because for example


		if we have collection of size 1 crore and we want add one more element, then new array will be created by collections and all 1 crore elements are copied in this new array and then 1 element will be added and previous array is ready for garbage collection.
		Therefore to add 1 element it has to copy all elements first.


-> Arays can hold both primitives and Objects but Collections can hold only Object types.

-> Collection Framework contains several Classes and Interfaces which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as single entity.
